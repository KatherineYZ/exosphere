# exosphere
##Exosphere is a lightweight web application designed to help users record and visualize their travel experiences. The system allows users to write travel journals, upload photos, and display visited locations on an interactive map. The backend will be implemented in Java with multi-threading support, while the frontend uses React.js for a responsive user interface.
All data, including user information, articles, and images, will be stored in a MySQL database.
